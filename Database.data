Umang Gupta : narendra modi image.
Jarvis : I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to display images. However, I can provide you with a description of Narendra Modi's appearance.

Narendra Modi is a 74-year-old Indian politician who is known for his distinctive appearance. He has a tall and slender build, with a height of around 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm). He has a fair complexion and a prominent nose. He is often seen wearing traditional Indian attire, including a kurta and pyjama, and a safa (a traditional Indian headgear).

If you would like to see an image of Narendra Modi, I can suggest some online sources such as Google Images or official news websites that may have his latest photographs.
Umang Gupta : band karega.
Jarvis : You want me to shut up, right?
Umang Gupta : band karega to usne usko translate how are you hello you bastard.
Jarvis : I think there's been a misunderstanding! "Band karega" is a Hindi phrase that roughly translates to "will shut up" or "will keep quiet".

However, the phrase "band karega to usne usko" doesn't make sense in Hindi. It seems like there might be some words missing or jumbled up.

As for the translation you provided, I'd like to clarify that it's not a correct or polite way to greet someone. If you'd like to greet someone in Hindi, a more common and respectful way would be to say "à¤¨à¤®à¤¸à¥à¤¤à¥" (Namaste) or "à¤¹à¥à¤²à¥" (Hello).
Umang Gupta : are yaar.
Jarvis : "Are yaar" is a casual way of saying "Hey, friend!" or "What's up, buddy?" in Hindi.
Umang Gupta : broker.
Jarvis : You said "broker". In Hindi, a broker is a person who acts as an intermediary between a buyer and a seller, facilitating the transaction.
Umang Gupta : real time.
Jarvis : You said "real time". In computing and technology, real-time refers to the ability of a system or application to respond to events or requests in real-time, i.e., instantly or within a very short time frame, often in a matter of milliseconds.
Umang Gupta : yeah yeah.
Jarvis : I get it! You're expressing enthusiasm or agreement, like saying "yes, yes" or "I'm with you"!
